				"They're waiting for my next move (next fatal breath)",
				"Human lives to me seem so unreal, can't see through the fog",
				"(Nothing past a grey wall) see past the stereotype",
				"Belief, structure built up in you",
				"I'll tear you down and the One who created you",
				"",
				"If they didn't have One how would they act?",
				"If we didn't have hope how would we behave?",

				"A good friend once told me you are memory",
